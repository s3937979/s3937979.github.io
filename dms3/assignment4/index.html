            The primary purpose of Shooting Dreams was to create a poetic and
            emotionally immersive space where users could externalise and
            release their inner thoughts or dreams. Rather than offering
            conventional feedback mechanisms or task-oriented goals, the project
            aimed to evoke a quiet sense of catharsis and reflection through
            symbolic visual transitions. By allowing the user to write a dream,
            choose an emotion, and then “send” it into the sky, the experience
            simulates a form of gentle emotional release, akin to whispering a
            wish to the stars. <br /><br />Importantly, dreams are often
            constructed from personal emotional responses to current life
            situations. As such, the act of writing a dream becomes an
            opportunity for self-reflection, allowing users to pause and observe
            their own emotional states. The project thus becomes not just a
            space for expression, but a mirror for interiority-inviting users to
            quietly examine what lies beneath their subconscious surface.

            Beyond novelty, Shooting Dreams prioritised emotional authenticity,
            gentle introspection, and poetic immersion as core values. The
            project did not seek to impress through technological complexity or
            visual spectacle, but rather through a quiet sensibility-inviting
            users to experience subtle emotional release and personal
            reflection. <br /><br />It valued emotional presence over
            performance-based feedback, trusting that the simple act of
            expressing a dream held intrinsic worth, even without external
            validation. It trusted that users would bring their own meaning to
            the process, and that the act of expressing a dream was
            intrinsically valuable, even if no explicit feedback was given in
            return.

            The design of Shooting Dreams was shaped by both technical and
            conceptual constraints that helped clarify its expressive goals.
            Technically, the project was built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript, avoiding external libraries to maintain simplicity
            and creative control. Initially, a Local Storage feature was
            considered to allow users to save and revisit their dreams. However,
            this functionality was ultimately removed-not because it clashed
            with the project’s emotional tone, but because it was deemed outside
            the intended scope of the assignment. As a result, the project's
            focus shifted from memory and retrieval to release and transience,
            transforming the act of writing a dream into a symbolic gesture of
            letting go, rather than preserving them. <br /><br />
            On a conceptual level, the project rejected goal-driven logic or
            explicit interaction in favour of ambiguity, slowness, and emotional
            atmosphere. The user journey was structured as a light emotional
            ritual: choosing a feeling, writing a dream, and watching it rise
            and dissolve into the sky. The absence of feedback or persistent
            data was intentional, ensuring that the experience remained
            ephemeral and reflective. These self-imposed limitations reinforced
            the project’s central aim-to offer a poetic space where inner
            emotions could be expressed and released, rather than stored or
            judged.

            The visual language of Shooting Dreams was carefully composed to
            evoke emotional resonance through simplicity, symbolism, and space.
            The project avoided detailed illustrations or dense visuals, instead
            embracing a minimal aesthetic that supports introspection. A key
            design decision was the use of emotion-based color coding: each
            selected feeling triggered a background or star color that subtly
            reflected the user's emotional state. This chromatic symbolism
            offered users a nonverbal but intuitive way to feel seen and
            acknowledged. <br /><br />
            The background remained mostly dark and subdued, invoking a night
            sky atmosphere and allowing text, stars, and transitions to emerge
            softly from the void. Transitions were slow and smooth, using
            opacity and fade techniques rather than cuts or abrupt changes, in
            order to preserve a sense of calm continuity. Instead of using
            literal metaphors or narrative visuals, the project leaned into
            symbolic abstraction, letting the user’s imagination complete the
            picture. This restraint fostered a contemplative visual space where
            emotion could unfold slowly and uninterrupted.

            The technical implementation of Shooting Dreams was shaped by a
            desire to create a lightweight yet emotionally immersive experience.
            All components were built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript,
            with no external libraries or frameworks. This decision was not only
            a practical one-ensuring broad browser compatibility and fast
            loading-but also an aesthetic one, preserving the simplicity and
            softness central to the project’s tone.

            <br /><br />
            Rather than focusing on functional complexity, the project
            emphasised timing, rhythm, and atmosphere. Key interactions-such as
            page transitions, dialog timing, emotion-based star changes, and
            animated text-were scripted manually using JavaScript and DOM
            manipulation. Visual effects like twinkling stars, floating
            headings, and fade-in messages were implemented through custom CSS
            keyframe animations, allowing for precise control over pacing and
            visual texture.

            <br /><br />This technical restraint helped maintain emotional
            focus. The minimalist implementation kept the interface quiet and
            unobtrusive, encouraging viewers to concentrate on mood and meaning
            rather than on interface mechanics. Every technical decision-down to
            the timing of animations and the layering of sound-was made to
            support the feeling of sending a dream into space, slowly and
            sincerely.

            The overall composition of Shooting Dreams was designed to create a
            unified emotional arc across three sequential visual stages. Each
            page-main, writing, and sending-is arranged to follow a slow and
            intentional rhythm, allowing the user to gradually move from passive
            observation to emotional release.
            <br /><br />Visual layers were arranged with care to guide user
            attention without distraction. Static full-screen background images
            provide immersive continuity, while floating animations and dialog
            boxes emerge at carefully timed intervals. These visual moments were
            paced not for information delivery but for emotional build-up,
            encouraging stillness and reflection between actions.
            <br /><br />Audio and visual transitions were also used to unify the
            experience. Looping background music provides consistency throughout
            the interaction, while the final page uses a fade-in message and
            animated star to gently close the interaction. Together, these
            elements form a rhythm of entry, expression, and release-composing
            the project as a meditative cycle rather than a functional tool.

            The navigation of Shooting Dreams was intentionally designed to
            follow a simple, linear flow with minimal user control. Rather than
            allowing users to click freely between pages, interaction is guided
            step-by-step-starting from the main page, progressing through a
            timed dream-writing sequence, and ending with a symbolic sending
            screen. This deliberate linearity reinforces the feeling of a ritual
            or journey.
            <br /><br />Each interaction was paced carefully. For example, after
            clicking the heading, the second page does not immediately display
            the input dialog. Instead, the character appears, lingers, and only
            then does the dialog open-encouraging a reflective pause. By
            structuring navigation through time-based progression and visual
            transitions, the project encourages the user to surrender control
            and follow the emotional flow rather than navigate actively.
            <br /><br />Non-verbal cues such as animations, fade-ins, and
            ambient sound further guide the user without requiring instruction.
            Navigation was not about moving through content efficiently, but
            about choreographing an experience of emotional pacing and eventual
            release.
