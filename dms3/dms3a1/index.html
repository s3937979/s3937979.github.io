    <h4>s3937979 Yeonwoo Hong</h4>

    <h2>research questions</h2>

    <h3>1. What genre of creative software do you believe it belongs to?</h3>

    <p>It belongs to the sandbox simulation game.</p>

    <h3>2. List three other examples of software in this genre</h3>

    <p>Sandspiel / Ecosystem / The Powder Toy</p>

    <h3>
      3. List the program's interactive features/mechanics (one sentence max
      explanation per feature/mechanic)
    </h3>

    <p>
      - Users can add elements like water, sand, fish, and bacteria to create
      userâ€™s own ecosystem. - Environmental conditions and interactions follow
      real-world physics and biological processes. - The system evolves over
      time, with organisms growing, dying, and reproducing based on resource
      availability.
    </p>

    <h3>
      4. What features/mechanics indicate its genre by aligning with its
      conventions?
    </h3>

    <p>
      It allows open-ended experimentation with complex, real-time interactions
      between elements, without strict goals or rules.
    </p>

    <h3>5. What features/mechanics are novel for its genre?</h3>

    <p>
      The ecosystem's self-sustaining cycle, real-time manipulation of
      biological processes, and dynamic evolution based on resource availability
      are unique features not commonly found in similar simulation games.
    </p>

    <h3>
      6. What features/mechanics common to its genre are missing or might be
      added?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Environmental disasters and a data visualization tool for tracking
      population and resources could add dynamic challenges and educational
      value.
    </p>

    <h3>
      7. What context, community or niche is it primarily aimed at and what
      indicates this?
    </h3>

    <p>
      It targets science enthusiasts and simulation lovers, focusing on
      ecological processes and experimentation, with no predefined goals,
      appealing to those who enjoy exploration and learning.
    </p>

    <h3>
      8. What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?
    </h3>

    <p>
      The lack of detailed solutions for ecosystem scenarios makes it hard to
      understand and engage with the system's challenges.
    </p>

    <h3>9. What did you find enjoyable about interacting with it?</h3>

    <p>
      The freedom to experiment and observe how the ecosystem evolves over time
      is interesting and novel.
