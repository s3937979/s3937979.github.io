          1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p class="vcenter">
          When I accessed the website, the first thing that caught my eye was
          the effect of resizing the browser window. The screen initially
          displayed a beach at dawn in warm reddish hues, with a small airplane
          parked by the dock. However, as I narrowed the window, the sun began
          to rise slowly over the horizon, and the entire color palette of the
          scene transformed. The red tones of early dawn gradually faded, giving
          way to blue tones of morning. It felt as though I was shifting the
          time of day through my interaction, and this subtle transition creates
          a sense of connection between myself and the experience.

          2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h2>
        <p>
          During my interaction, I resized the browser window to observe how the
          visual scene would respond. I checked whether there was any background
          music, and then focused on how the screen transitioned while dragging
          the wheel at the bottom of the screen, I paused occasionally to watch
          the background animations and read the accompanying text. I also
          clicked on images to see what kinds of animation effects would be
          triggered through interaction.

          3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I spent the most time on reading the poem in three chapters, The
          Archipelago, The Beach, and The City, with an animated background of
          the experience. The illustration movement was visually engaging, which
          allowed me to concentrate on the words while still feeling immersed in
          the atmosphere. It felt like the visuals and the text were part of a
          single artistic flow, encouraging me to linger longer in that moment.

        <p>
          The most common action I repeated during the two minute interaction
          was dragging the wheel at the bottom of the screen with my mouse. Each
          drag triggered a transition to the next scene, so I kept interacting
          with it to explore how the different scenes were structured and
          connected.

        <p>
          The primary goal of this interactive experience is to promote the
          limited edition watch through a sensorial and artistic journey.
          Instead of directly presenting product specifications, the website
          immerses the user in a three-chapter narrative built around the theme
          of an “Endless Summer”. This experience encourages users to
          emotionally connect with the product, helping them understand its
          essence not through technical features, but through mood, visual
          atmosphere, and storytelling.

          6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The experience communicates its goal without providing any direct
          information about the watch. It uses animated backgrounds combined
          with poetic texts and cozy background music to create a warm,
          immersive atmosphere. Additionally, the drag wheel at the bottom of
          the screen lets users move through scenes as if they are moving
          through time. The structure reinforces the feeling that the watch is
          not just a product, but part of a flowing, emotional journey.

          7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? <br />(For how long and how many different times)
        </h2>
        <p>
          The website seems designed for a short, focused interaction of roughly
          five minutes in one sitting. With its three chapters and continuous
          visual flow, it feels like an art film that is meant to be experienced
          all at once.

          8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It communicates that the experience should be shown in a linear,
          time-based flow. The timeline is described on the bottom wheel, which
          marks the passage of time as users progress through the chapters like
          morning, afternoon, night in a day. However, the presence of a button
          that allows users to re-read the poem suggests that some elements are
          meant to be revisited. The experience balances a linear, immersive
          structure with small interactive moments that invite reflection and
          repeated engagement, especially with the more poetic aspects.

          9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I believe the website is like an art film that centers on the passage
          of the time and unfolds with a strong emotional rhythm, making it feel
          more like a visual piece than a conventional website. At the same
          time, it reminded me of luxury watch campaign sites, where the goal is
          not to present product specs but to immerse the user in a mood. It
          also felt similar to a visual interactive essay, blending animation,
          poetry, and user interaction in a way that made it feel like a digital
          poetry book.

        <p>
          The references suggest that I should not rush through the experience
          and be navigated for information. Instead, it invites a slower, more
          mindful way of engaging like watching an art film or reading a poetry
          book. It is not about finding answers or checking boxes, but about
          feeling the mood, taking in the visuals, and letting the experience
          unfold at its own pace. I felt encouraged to respond emotionally, not
          analytically.

        <p>
          The experience encourages a calm, reflective emotional state. The
          colors, the poetic writing, the soft transitions, and the cozy
          background music all work together to create a warm, soothing
          atmosphere. Instead of making me feel rushed or analytical, it invited
          me to slow down and simply feel. It felt like being suspended in a
          slow summer afternoon.

        </h2>
        <p>
          The most frustrating part of the interaction was that the experience
          only worked properly when the browser window was resized to a narrow
          width or when viewed on a mobile device. On a regular desktop screen,
          key visuals did not display as intended unless I manually adjusted the
          window size. I felt like the full effect was only accessible under
          specific conditions, which could be frustrating for users on different
          devices or screen setups.

        </h2>
        <p>
          The most satisfying part of the experience was the way to drag the
          wheel around the bottom of the screen to move between scenes. Unlike a
          simple click or scroll, it felt like I was physically shifting time
          with my own hand, which made the interaction feel fresh and personal.
          The transitions were smooth and visually cohesive, allowing for
          emotional immersion while also giving me a sense of control over the
          flow of the experience.
